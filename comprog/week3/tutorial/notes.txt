tie(i, p) = t
// https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple/tie




NOTE: use more functions - learn all the passes by value/reference and so on by heart

Cheat sheet:
<-- query template (a lot of while statements?)
<-- priority_queue< foo<bar,bar>, vector<foo,bar>, greater<pair<int,int>>> name_of_the_queue;
generally priority_queue returns normally the largest element, by putting in the greater it returns the smallest element
